# Automation Test Execution Framework 

## Agile Internship Documentation
My Agile Methodology Document
(Agile_Document_Infosys_Springboard.docx)

##  Overview
The **Automation Test Execution Framework** is a Spring Boot–based backend application designed to manage, execute, and monitor automated test jobs in a structured and scalable way.

This project was developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship Program** to demonstrate real-world backend development concepts such as REST APIs, layered architecture, database integration, and clean code practices.

The framework acts as a central engine where automation test executions can be triggered, tracked, and extended in the future with advanced orchestration features.

---

## Objectives of the Project
- Build a clean and modular **test execution backend**
- Expose REST APIs to verify application health and execution readiness
- Use **Spring Boot best practices**
- Demonstrate database connectivity using **Spring Data JPA**
- Maintain a **professional GitHub repository** with documentation and license

---

## Tech Stack Used
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.5.9**
- **Spring Web (REST APIs)**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **H2 In-Memory Database**
- **Maven**
- **Apache Tomcat (Embedded)**
- **Git & GitHub**

## Key Features Implemented

### Health Check API
A REST endpoint to verify that the application is running successfully.

**Endpoint**

GET /health

**Response**
Automation Test Framework is running successfully 


This confirms:
- Application startup is successful
- Embedded Tomcat is running
- REST layer is working correctly

---

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 installed
- Internet connection (for Maven dependencies)
- VS Code / IntelliJ (optional but recommended)

### Steps
```bash
cd automation-test-framework
cd automation-test-framework
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

Access in Browser
http://localhost:8080/health
